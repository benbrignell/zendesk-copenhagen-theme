# Zendesk Copenhagen responsive theme export

There's no current way to download a theme from zendesk. It's only possible to edit a theme by copying/pasting into the zendesk code editor.

The [Copenhagen theme](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/copenhagen-responsive-help-center-theme/) is a good starting point for developing your own responsive theme.

This export allows you to work on your theme locally and at least be able to version control it in github. You will still have to copy/paste your edits into zendesk to preview changes on the site.
